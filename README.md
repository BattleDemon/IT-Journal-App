# Journal App

## Table of Context

## Preplanning

### What are Diary and Journalling Apps

### Core Features
Text entry 

Save and Load



### What Additional Features I Will Add
Calendar View: Able to view entries by a calendar where days with an entrie are highlighted and selectable to view.

Search functionality: Able to search based on day entrie name and entry tag

Tag Entries: Able to tag key words to the entry

Dark / Light Mode: maybe a preset ligh and dark modes or the possibility to have a customisable theme

### Flowchart

### If I Get More Time
A Cloud back up system maybe using git would be intresting.

Voice to text input could also be a fun idea but might require some more complex abilities.
