# Journal App

## Table of Context

## Preplanning

### Core Features

Calendar Selection: the ability to view a calendar page and select a date to view. Dates with entries are highlighted.

Text Editor: Basic area which can have text entered into.

Save and Load: The saving of entries and their dates.

### What Additional Features I Will Add

Themes: The abilitie to change the appearance of the app to one of many preset themes, maybe expand to fully customisable without presets.

Advanced Text Settings: Enable bold, italic, and text size, maybe also color other than the theme one, maybe highlights.

Favourourite / Pinned: Enable the favouriting and pinning of entires which will be at the top of the side pannel even when sorting.

Catogories: Abilitie to enter any number of catogories in a field area, seperatored by commas.

Softing and filtering entries: Sort enries by date, title name, last opened and filter out specific catogories and uncatogoriesed entries.

Search Entries: a search field to look up entries based on their date or title.

### UI Design

Simple UI that resembles a IDE with the files / entires on a sidebar to the left, and a central field used for the input of text and the calendar selcetion. With text options above the text field, and a save button below the text field which i might also enable with a button for ctrl+s, next to which is the section for editing catogories.

### If I Get More Time

A Cloud back up system: cloud back up using git to store enties.

Voice to text input: button to dictate the entries.
