### Flowchart

Belows is the flowchart on what order I wish to complete the assingment. Unfortionately after the making of the below Flowchart I added a new section on Suggested systems which goes inbetween the End section and if I Have more time.

### UI Design

Simple UI that resembles a IDE with the files / entires on a sidebar to the left, and a central field used for the input of text and the calendar selcetion. With text options above the text field, and a save button below the text field which i might also enable with a button for ctrl+s, next to which is the section for editing catogories.

I also questioned Kirsty which resulted in the following suggestions:

Change Font

Emoji's or pictures to represent mood

Set the weather that day.

After questioning Kirsty this is the new systems she suggested Change Font : Have empji or something like that so signal your mood that day : a section to put the weather 

### If I Get More Time
