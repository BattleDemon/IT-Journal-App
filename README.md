### UI Design

Simple UI that resembles a IDE with the files / entires on a sidebar to the left, and a central field used for the input of text and the calendar selcetion. With text options above the text field, and a save button below the text field which i might also enable with a button for ctrl+s, next to which is the section for editing catogories.
